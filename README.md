# ðŸ“˜ Mathematical Finance II â€“ Continuous Time Finance (TUM 2025)

Welcome to the repository for the **Mathematical Finance II** course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), 2025 edition. This course delves into continuous-time finance, covering topics such as stochastic calculus, derivative pricing, and risk-neutral valuation. Here, you'll find coding exercises and projects that complement the theoretical concepts discussed in lectures.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

The exercises and projects in this repository encompass:

- **Stochastic Processes**: Brownian motion, martingales, and stochastic differential equations.
- **Option Pricing**: Black-Scholes model, Greeks, and implied volatility.
- **Interest Rate Models**: Vasicek, CIR, and HJM frameworks.
- **Numerical Methods**: Monte Carlo simulations, finite difference methods.
- **Risk Management**: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall.

*Note: Topics will be expanded as the course progresses.*
